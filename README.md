My experience, projects and portfolio
Iâ€™m a lifelong learner, data and evidence-driven human
behavior professional, with a solid background in mental
health, education, and diversity-focused practice, now
transitioning into human-centered roles in the private
sector. With 5 years as a psychologist, I bring a deep
understanding of human behavior, strong communication
skills, and analytical thinking, developed through work in
healthcare, public service, NGOs, and 3 publication
projects in academic research. At the moment. I'm eager
to apply these skills in areas such as people analytics,
applied research or HR.
